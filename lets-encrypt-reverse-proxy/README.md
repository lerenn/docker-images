# lets-encrypt-reverse-proxy

Docker image for a https-safe reverse proxy, powered by nginx and lets encrypt.

**IMPORTANT**: Please read informations about Let's Encrypt at the end of this document.

## Build

To create the image `lerenn/lets-encrypt-reverse-proxy`, execute the following command on the reverse-proxy project folder:

    docker build -t lerenn/lets-encrypt-reverse-proxy .

## Run

If you want to use a reverse-proxy on HTTP and/or HTTPS websites, here is the basic command :

    docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v /path/in/host:/etc/letsencrypt -v /path/in/host:/etc/nginx/sites-enabled -e CERT1="example.com;subdomain.example.com" lerenn/nginx-reverse-proxy

## Arguments

### Volumes

* **/etc/nginx/sites-enabled** : [Mandatory] Should contains nginx configurations for redirections to websites/web apps.
* **/etc/letsencrypt** : [Optional] Should contains lets encrypt. Mount it should avoid regeneration of certifcates.

### Ports

* **80**: [Optional] HTTP port.
* **443**: [Mandatory] HTTPS port.

### Environment variables

* **CERT[X]**: [Mandatory] domain and subdomains, separated by `;` that will be generated by Let's Encrypt ([X] should be replaced by a number). Example: `-e CERT1="example.com;subdom.example.com;subdom2.example.com -e CERT2="example2.com;subdom.example2.com"`
* **LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL**: [Mandatory] E-mail that will be given to lets encrypt in order to generate certificates. Defaults to `none`.
* **RSA_KEY_SIZE**: [Optional] Size of RSA keys that will be generated or renewed. Defaults to `4096`.
* **STARTUP_WAIT**: [Optional] Seconds to wait before launching LetsEncrypt and then Nginx. Defaults to `0`.

### Links

[Mandatory] Add links to other container with `--link source-container-name:alias-container-name` as an argument.
Then, you'll have to add `http://alias-container-name` into your nginx website/webapp configuration to redirect flux.

### /!\ Warnings /!\

There is some limits to certificates generation. At the time of writing, it's **20 certificates by week**.

To **avoid certificate regeneration** at each container creation, please consider **mounting volume `/etc/letsencrypt`** in the container.

For more informations: https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/.

### Certificates generation and renewal

Certificates specified in arguments are created when the container is (re)started.
Same goes for certificates renewal: certbot will try to renew present certificates
(even those that are not in arguments) if they will expire in less than 30 days or
if they are already expired.

Maybe one day, I will add the possibility of a cron job that will check if there is
a need for renewal (but not now, I have "Aqua-pony").

### Use of certificates

After the generation of the certificates, you can find them at `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>`.
The certificate will be generated as `fullchain.pem` and the private key as `privkey.pem`.
Every subdomain is registered within the same certificate.

For `example.com`, you'll find the :
* Certificate at `/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem`
* Private key at `/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem`
